Challenge VII

Create code replicating vehicles to demonstrate the pillars of OOP.
There should be a Vehicle super class, and at least one interface such as 'Bus', 
or 'Ship' representing a classification of vehicles. 


The Superclass
The vehicle should contain states that track the number of vehicles, speed, and an enum 
declaring the mode of transport (AIR, WATER, or LAND.) as well as behaviors for movement and stopping.
 

The Interface
The interface should contain abstract methods pertaining to that vehicle class.


The Class
Finally you should make a class that extends the vehicle and implements the interface that
provides its own implementations, as well as demonstrating overriding, overloading, constructor chaining, 
and the this and super keywords. Endeavor to prevent redundant code, and ensure that invalid values 
cannot be passed to states like speed.

Challenge VIII
Create a custom exception, throw that exception in a method, and in another method that contains a 
try-catch-finally block, handle it.
