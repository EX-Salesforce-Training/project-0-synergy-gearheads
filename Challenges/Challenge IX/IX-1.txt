/*Challenge IX
Create a trigger on the account object, it should follow all best practices. 
Opportunities represent potential deals with our clients and we do not want to delete any accounts which have opportunities whose stage 
is not 'Closed Won' or 'Closed Lost'. If an account is found to have active opportunities we should prevent its deletion with a message 
that provides an explanation on why it cannot be deleted. 

We've recently determined that California is no longer a profitable locale to operate our specific business in. As such we are no 
longer accepting new accounts whose location is in California. Ensure that any new accounts are prohibited from being created if that 
is their home location with a appropriate message detailing why. 

Any new account who has no related contact should have a generic placeholder created from the accounts data and related to it.*/
